Three files containing words were created: subject.txt, object.txt and verb.txt, containing subjects, objects and verbs respectively.
In the simple version of the program, no irregular verbs and verbs ending in 'e' were chosen, and the person and number of the object were
not taken into consideration, whereas in the extended version, the files above were extended into subject_extended.txt, object_extended.txt,
and verb_extended.txt, which contained irregular verbs and verbs ending in 'e'. The extended program also took the number and person of the 
subject into consideration.

Purely iterative and purely recursive programs were written for the simple version of the program, and a purely recursive version was 
written for the extended version of the program.

In all three versions, lists were made of the subjects, objects and verbs in the text files, and various combinations of these were printed.
The formed sentences were modified in order to conform to the rules of English grammar. The simple program considered the use of the definite 
article and also the tenses of the verbs whereas the extended program considered these as well as the persons of the subjects and objects and the
numbers of the subjects and objects.

In the iterative simple version, three nested for loops were used, and all the possible combinations were considered and modified, then printed.

In the recursive versions, a function was defined taking the three lists, and the base case was when the length of each list is one.
In the general case, one of the list was split into two parts, one containing only the first element, and the other containing the remainder
of the list. This was done recursively until all the combinations of list elements were considered.
