In the C programs (program1.c and program2.c), which were written from a Procedural (non Object Oriented) Perspective,
there were no classes/structs/objects. 

We mainly used functions instead of classes/structs/objects.


In the C++ programs (program1.cpp and program2.cpp) the variables from the C programs were wrapped into classes with appropriate member functions.
These programs were written in an Object Oriented Perspective.
