1. Type out all programs in slides (lecture slides) and run them, feel free to modify them and write your observations, findings in observations.txt (don't submit the programs)

2. solve these problems using anything appropriate from among for iterations, while looping, function definitions, lists, sets, and functions on them
   a) given two lists, find frequency of occurence of common elements. output that in a separate list of lists. for example
   L1 = [1,2,3,1,4]
   L2 = [1,1,2,2,21,9,4] 

  freq(L1, L2)  to return list of lists [ [1,4], [2,4], [4,2] ]
   b) given a set, produce  a powerset, which is a set of all subsets
 of that set
 L1 = {1,2,3}

 power(L1) would return { {},{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}


you can submit your solutions to part 2 in two python files.

submit as much as you solve it. solutions should be smaller and
neater given the simplicity and power of python constructs.
