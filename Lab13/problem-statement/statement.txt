1) Make a database for the following facts:
batsman, matchid, score
and make rules to find batsmen who score more than 5 centuries

for example, a database could be of the form:
record(sachin,ie2123,129).
record(sachin,ie2123,134).


2) Try writing a declarative logic program to find minimum of a
list of numbers

3) Try writing a declarative logic program to sort elements
in an array

4) A program with cut operator (!) has been supplied in class
folder LogicProgramming on moodle. The cut operator is used
to look for another solution. Try experimenting with it by
placing it at different places in the program, like at
the end of list of subgoals, in between subgoals, or at
the end of a terminating rule, and write your observations
on its working.
