We won't use loops, variable assignments, global values, and still solve computational problems. In continuation with what we discussed today, in the lab we explore one such paradigm- the logic programming paradigm. We will use gnu prolog interpreter gprolog. Join me for a follow me part after which a problem statement will be released. Two videos have been posted separately: one on installation of gprolog and one about a simple program in prolog with execution instructions.

Problems to be solved:
mylast(L,E)

myreverse([A|L],[B|U]).

palindrome([A|L])

myappend([A|L],[B|U],[A|R])

submit

-- four programs-- all can be in one file 
- one observations.txt explain briefly your idea of how it works

do on your own, understand them.
