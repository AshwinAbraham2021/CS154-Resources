In mylast function, we impose the condition that mylast of a singleton list is the only element of the list.
For lists with more than one element, we impose the condition that the last element of the list is recursively the last element of the tail.

For myreverse, we use a helper function, removelast which gives the list - it's last element
We impose that myreverse of the empty list and the singleton list are themselves and myreverse of other lists have the first and last elements 
swapped and the middle is recursively the reverse of the original middle.

For palindrome, we use myreverse and impose that the reverse of the list is itself.

For myappend, we impose that the head of the list remains the same, and the tail is recursively the myappend of the tail of the original and the 2nd list.
